# ⚡ Neethu M  
### Blockchain Engineer | Web3 Systems Developer | Distributed Ledger Architect  

I architect decentralized systems with **protocol-first thinking**, secure smart contract logic,  
and scalable backend infrastructures for real-world finance + identity systems.

> I don't just write blockchain — I design how trust flows.

### 🧠 Core Strengths  
- Smart Contract Engineering (Ethereum + DAML)  
- Hyperledger Fabric & Canton Based Enterprise Networks  
- CBDC Systems, Tokenized RWA, Digital Money Markets  
- dApp Architecture · Ledger-driven Backend APIs  
- MERN Stack — UI that’s functional, minimal and purposeful

## 🔥 Major Projects

| Project | Stack | What I Built |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **CBDC Simulation (Retail Layer)** | Hyperledger Fabric · Node.js · Docker | Architected full retail CBDC lifecycle — onboarding → issuance → transfer → redemption. Smart contracts + API gateway with RBAC & wholesale sync. |
| **RWA Fractional Tokenization** | DAML · Canton · Node | Tokenized real estate assets into fractions. Designed contract rules, mint flows, ownership transfer + investor API. Instant ledger settlement. |
| **Digital Money Market (T-Bill Tokenization)** | DAML · Canton | Built treasury bill tokenization, purchase, redemption flow. Ownership update via secure signature workflows + domain configuration. |
| **SSI-Based Digital Diploma System** | Hyperledger Identus · React | DID-enabled credential flow — issuer → holder → verifier. Wallet issuance, on-chain signature verification, trust without central DB. |
| **TicketMaster DApp** | Solidity · Hardhat · React · MetaMask | On-chain ticket lifecycle — seat minting, purchase, non-duplicable ownership. Eliminates fraud & double-booking. |
